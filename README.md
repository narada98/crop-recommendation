# crop-recommendation
 machine learning - precision agriculture
 
 ## Motivation

Over 30 percent of Sri Lankans are employed in the
agricultural sector.
The agriculture sector contributes about 7.4 percent to
the national GDP
Although Sri Lanka is a fertile tropical land with the
potential for the cultivation and processing of a
variety of crops, issues such as productivity and
profitability hamper the growth of the sector

## Technologies

This Machine learning model is created using scikit learn library
Model is trained and evaluated in a jupyter notebook and deployed to an AWS end point

## Features

Crop recommedation system takes in soil and weather data to recommend the optimum crop for that farm land.


## Progress
Exploratory data analysis(EDA) for the data set

feature enegineering (cleaning, feature selection)

Choosing the best algorithm to build a classifier

Evaluation of the model
